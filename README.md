## About Me

I am a **Research Associate** at the **University of Oklahoma**, with a **Ph.D. in Seismology and Tectonics** from the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. My work centers on the intersection of seismology, tectonics, and data science to address critical questions in Earth science.

My primary research interests include:
-   **Crustal Structure & Tectonics:** Investigating the crustal morphology of the North American Midcontinent using receiver functions (H-Îº-c) and ambient noise tomography.
-   **Induced Seismicity:** Monitoring and analyzing anthropogenic earthquakes, particularly those related to energy production and carbon sequestration.
-   **Machine Learning in Geosciences:** Applying advanced AI/ML techniques, such as transfer learning, for microseismic event detection and analysis.
-   **Carbon Management:** Contributing to the safety and efficiency of geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects through seismological monitoring.

## About This Repository

This repository contains the source code for my personal academic website, built with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The site serves as a central hub for my research, publications, teaching materials, and coding projects.

## Website Highlights

*   **[Research](https://hy-x.github.io/#Research):** An overview of my key research projects, including visualizations from my work on the Illinois and Michigan Basins.
*   **[Science Insights](https://hy-x.github.io/Knowledge.html):** A collection of articles and FAQs explaining complex topics like receiver functions, ambient noise tomography, and induced seismicity for a broader audience.
*   **[Code & Tutorials](https://hy-x.github.io/Codes.html):** A showcase of my programming skills with practical tutorials on Python, Shell scripting, SAC, and data analysis in Jupyter Notebooks.
