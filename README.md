## About Me

I am a **Research Associate** at the **University of Oklahoma**, with a **Ph.D. in Seismology and Tectonics** from the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**. My work centers on the intersection of seismology, tectonics, and data science to address critical questions in Earth science.

My primary research interests include:
-   **Crustal Structure & Tectonics:** Investigating the crustal morphology of the North American Midcontinent using receiver functions (H-κ-c) and ambient noise tomography.
-   **Induced Seismicity:** Monitoring and analyzing anthropogenic earthquakes, particularly those related to energy production and carbon sequestration.
-   **Machine Learning in Geosciences:** Applying advanced AI/ML techniques, such as transfer learning, for microseismic event detection and analysis.
-   **Carbon Management:** Contributing to the safety and efficiency of geological carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects through seismological monitoring.
